# QSO_var

This is a python code for ensemble studies of AGN in X-rays.
Modulated to simulate, resample LCs, use adequate photometry and load XMM-Newton or eRosita LCs, apply Bayesian algorithms (Nested Sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) for sampling and inference of the ensemble normalised excess variance.
Will infer SMBH mass and accretion rate based on four (4) different models.
